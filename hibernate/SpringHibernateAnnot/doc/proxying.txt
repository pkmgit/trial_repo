SPRING AOP supports both

1.JDK Dynamic proxy can only proxy by interface 
(so your target class needs to implement an interface, 
which will also be implemented by the proxy class.

2.CGLIB (and javassist) can create a proxy by subclassing. 
In this scenario the proxy becomes a subclass of the target class. 
No need for interfaces.
